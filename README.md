## Python virtual environment

If you plan to use Python in this project, create a virtual environment to isolate dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` file should list any third-party Python packages you add. Currently the project does not include Python dependencies.
